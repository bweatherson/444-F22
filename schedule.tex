\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course has three parts.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Game Theory} - We will review the basics of game theory, with
  a special focus on the philosophical assumptions that game theorists
  make, and the ways in which game theory can model the development of
  cooperative activity. This will be the longest unit, taking up the
  first half of the course.
\item
  \textbf{The Origins of Inequality} - We will look at recent work using
  game theoretic techniques to model how inequality, and in particular
  gender inequality, could have arisen out of an equal society. This
  will take up the third quarter of the course.
\item
  \textbf{Group Attitudes} - We will look at what it could mean for
  groups to have beliefs, desires, plans, intentions and knowledge. This
  will take up the last quarter of the course.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\section{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from
\url{https://canvas.umich.edu}. Course documents (syllabus, lecture
notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure
that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for
announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are
many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

There are two textbooks for the course. The first is open access, but
the second has to be purchased.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Game Theory} by Giacomo Bonanno, available at
  \url{http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html}.
\item
  \emph{The Origins of Unfairness} by Cailin O'Connor. (Oxford
  University Press, 2019)
\end{itemize}

For the O'Connor book, you can either get an electronic or a paper
version of the book, it shouldn't matter which. (I'll be teaching off of
the Kindle version, but I will refer to page numbers not Kindle
locations.)

The other readings will all be available through the university library,
and will be linked on Canvas.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Do the readings! There will be video lectures that explain and expand
  on the readings, but they are less important than actually reading.
\item
  Participate in the discussion sections. You do not have to attend the
  lectures. The actual lecturing will all be by pre-recorded
  slides/videos, and will be posted ahead of time. I will turn up for
  the time of the scheduled lectures, but I'll just be taking questions,
  and I suspect we'll often finish early. Participation in these
  effectively open office hours is encouraged, but voluntary. But
  participation in the discussion sections is required.
\item
  Complete 5 of the 6 weekly assignments from part 1 of the course. (You
  should complete all six, but only the best five will count for credit
  - this is to allow you to drop one if there is some emergency one
  week. If 2021 is anything like 2020, I suspect this will be something
  many of us need.)
\item
  Write short papers (5-6 pages, or about 1500 words) for both the
  second and third parts of the course. The topics for these will be
  distributed in advance. The first is due on \textbf{April 5} and the
  second is due on \textbf{April 26}.
\end{enumerate}

Both of the papers may be co-written with one other student in the
class. But you may not co-author both papers with the same other
student.

\hypertarget{summary-of-grading-system}{%
\section{Summary of Grading System}\label{summary-of-grading-system}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Weekly assignments - 10\% each, 5 assignments, 50\% total.
\item
  Two papers - 25\% each, 2 papers, 50\% total.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\section{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is
strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of
your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct
quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably
clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation
scheme that works well in philosophy, look at
\url{http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4}.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including
assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in
under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work
of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of
the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to
each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows
that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the
College of Literature, Science \& the Arts at the University of
Michigan, which are available here:
\url{http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/}. Violations of these
policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for
Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

\newpage

\hypertarget{disability}{%
\section{Disability}\label{disability}}

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be
provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional
and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the
semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to
register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The
office is located at G664 Haven Hall.

For more information on disability services at the University of
Michigan, go to \url{http://ssd.umich.edu}.

\hypertarget{virtual}{%
\section{Virtual}\label{virtual}}

This course is being taught virtually because of the still raging
pandemic. Hopefully we all learned a bit from virtual teaching/learning
in the Fall, but it's still new for a lot of us. I suspect I'll get some
things wrong, and I'll have to make adjustments on the fly. If/when that
happens, I'll do everything I can to make sure everything is done fairly
- but if I don't, you should let me know that I'm messing up.

The college has put a lot of things in place for this rather distinctive
semester, including extended add/drop deadlines, and a new grade of NRC.
I won't repeat here all of what they've done, in part because I suspect
that will be changing as the semester goes along. But I wanted you to
know that I know this semester will be a challenge for all of us. And
I'll do what I can to make it as productive an educational experience as
it can be - even if that isn't as good as what you'd have hoped for.

\newpage

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

Most of the readings are from the two textbooks. The other readings are
all in the UM library or online. You might have to be logged in to UM to
get them though. The names of the papers are links to a source where you
can get a copy of the paper.

The video lectures will have a number of the form \(x.y\), where \(x\)
is the week they are for, and the \(y\) is their order in the week.
There will typically be 8-10 lectures each week, each of them roughly
10-12 minutes. (Especially after the break, the number of lectures each
week is subject to change; I'll let you know if/when it updates.)
